# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LAMMPS-GUI (v3.x) is a Qt6-based graphical interface for the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation software. It provides a code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion, live LAMMPS simulation execution, log/chart/image visualization, and an integrated tutorial system. The project is GPLv2+ licensed (note: `thirdparty/rangeslider/rangeslider.{cpp,h}` is third-party under the CeCILL-A license).

- Online documentation: https://lammps-gui.lammps.org/
- C++17, CMake ≥ 3.20, Qt6 (minimum 6.2; only the Gui, Widgets, Network, and Svg modules — charts are rendered natively, so no Qt Charts/Graphs/Quick)

## Build Commands

**Typical plugin-mode build** (LAMMPS library loaded dynamically at runtime — the default):
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DLAMMPS_GUI_USE_PLUGIN=ON -DBUILD_DOC=OFF
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

**Linked mode** (requires LAMMPS source tree and pre-built library):
```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DLAMMPS_GUI_USE_PLUGIN=OFF \
  -DLAMMPS_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/lammps/src \
  -DLAMMPS_LIBRARY=/path/to/liblammps.so
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

Default install prefix is `$HOME/.local` (no root required).

**Useful CMake options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LAMMPS_GUI_USE_PLUGIN` | `ON` | Load LAMMPS `.so` at runtime via dlopen |
| `BUILD_DOC` | `ON` | Build Sphinx HTML docs along with the app (slow; disable for code-only work) |
| `BUILD_DOC_ONLY` | `OFF` | Build only Sphinx/Doxygen docs, skip the C++ binary entirely |
| `ENABLE_TESTING` | `OFF` | Enable unit + GUI tests (Linux only) |

**Documentation-only build** (no C++ compilation needed):
```bash
cmake -S . -B build-doc -DBUILD_DOC_ONLY=ON
cmake --build build-doc --target doc
# Output: build-doc/doc/html/index.html
```

**Documentation build targets** (when `BUILD_DOC=ON` or `BUILD_DOC_ONLY=ON`):

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `html` / `doc` | Full Sphinx HTML docs (runs Doxygen first) |
| `doxygen` | Doxygen XML only (intermediate step) |
| `pdf` | LaTeX → PDF (requires `pdflatex` + `latexmk`) |
| `spelling` | Sphinx spell checker |
| `linkcheck` | Sphinx broken-link checker |

## Testing

Tests are Linux-only and off by default. Enable them at configure time:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DLAMMPS_GUI_USE_PLUGIN=ON -DBUILD_DOC=OFF -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run a subset by name pattern (tests are registered under their GoogleTest suite
names, e.g. `HelpersTest.*`, not the executable names):
```bash
ctest --test-dir build -R HelpersTest --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R Framebuffer --output-on-failure   # GUI tests need Xvfb + screenshooter
```

**Test categories:**
- `test_*` executables — C++ unit tests (GoogleTest v1.17.0, fetched automatically
  via FetchContent); one per tested module: helpers, stdcapture, flagwarnings,
  dumpimage, movieimport, imagecache, leastsquares, plotdata, lepton, levmar,
  customfunc, analysis, plotaxismath, plotblockdata, fitting, shortcuts,
  windowlayout, tutorialcontent, tutorialengine, and tutorialtext
- `CommandLine.*` — command-line flag smoke tests
- `Framebuffer.*` — Python/PyAutoGUI GUI tests run inside Xvfb; require `xvfb-run` and one of: `magick`, `import`, `xfce4-screenshooter`, or `gnome-screenshot`

## Static analysis (CodeQL)

The `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow runs CodeQL on every push to `develop` in
**build mode** (it compiles via CMake) with the `security-and-quality` query
suite; its config is `.github/codeql/cpp.yml`. Two settled points:

- **`paths`/`paths-ignore` do nothing for built C/C++.** CodeQL honors them only
  for interpreted languages or `build-mode: none`, so they cannot scope analysis
  to `src/` or exclude `thirdparty/`, `plugin/`, or generated `build/` moc files;
  dismiss those alerts in the code-scanning UI instead.
- **Do not switch to `build-mode: none`.** It was tried and reverted: on this Qt
  codebase, no-build extraction misparses the `slots`/`signals` macros (reported
  as `int` bit-fields), cannot resolve cross-file references (false "unused"
  statics), and has weak dataflow (false `constant-comparison`) -- roughly 50
  false positives. Build mode analyzes the real compiled + moc output and is
  accurate.

## Code Style

All C++ source is formatted with **clang-format** using the config in `.clang-format` (LLVM base, 4-space indent, 100-column limit, custom brace wrapping). Before committing:
```bash
clang-format -i src/*.cpp src/*.h
```

File headers use `// -*- c++ -*-` Emacs mode line; maintain it on new files.

## Commit & Code Conventions

- **GPG-sign all commits.** Every commit must carry a verifiable GPG signature.
- **No `Co-Authored-By:` or `Claude-Session:` attribution in commit messages.** AI attribution belongs in pull request descriptions only.
- **Doxygen comments on all new public APIs.** Use `/** @brief ... */` Javadoc style for classes and methods; `///< description` for member variables. See `src/lammpsgui.h` for a comprehensive example.
- **New public classes need a `.. doxygenclass::` entry in `doc/api_reference.rst`.** The `helpers.h` block uses `.. doxygenfile:: helpers.h :sections: func`, which renders only *free functions*, so a new helper class (e.g. an RAII guard) is otherwise missing from the generated API docs.
- **Documentation changes in American English with plain ASCII characters** (no typographic quotes, em-dashes as `--`, etc.).
- **New `.cpp`/`.h` files must be added to `PROJECT_SOURCES`** in `cmake/Sources.cmake`. Qt's `AUTOMOC` handles `moc` generation automatically, but the file must be listed there. The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` holds only the configuration options and the executable target; the remaining build logic lives in include files under `cmake/` (Platform, Sources, Testing, Sanitizer, Documentation, Packaging).

```

### Key design points

**Interactive tutorials are data.** A guided tutorial is a JSON content file
under `resources/tutorials/`, validated at load time with path-addressed
diagnostics; adding one is a content file plus a line in
`LammpsGui::interactiveContentFor()`. **Before authoring or changing tutorial
content, read `doc/tutorial-authoring.md`** -- it opens with the pedagogical
constraint the feature has to satisfy (a tour that writes the script for you
can produce a user who learned nothing, and user enthusiasm is not evidence it
worked), then covers the two source tutorial styles, the fading ladder of
interaction, the invariants, the placement rules (`section` / `before` /
`highlight` / `replaces`), the schema reference, and the verification recipe --
the best of which is diffing the tour's output against the article's own
`solution/*.lmp`. `doc/tutorial-mode-design.md`
and `doc/tutorial-mode-redesign.md` record how the model got here.

**Plugin vs. linked mode.** When built with `LAMMPS_GUI_USE_PLUGIN=ON` (default), the executable has no link-time dependency on LAMMPS. `plugin/liblammpsplugin.c` provides `dlopen`-based dispatch; `LammpsWrapper` calls through function pointers loaded at startup. This lets the GUI ship as a standalone binary that can download or swap LAMMPS shared libraries.

**Native chart rendering.** Charts are drawn by a single self-contained renderer, `PlotWidget` (`src/plotwidget.{cpp,h}`), a `QWidget`+`QPainter` 2D line/scatter plotter that depends only on Qt Widgets — no Qt Charts, Qt Graphs, or QML. `ChartWindow` owns one `ChartColumn` per thermo column — the neutral `PlotSeries` data objects (`src/plotseries.h`) live there — plus a *single* `ChartViewer` that is rebound (via `setColumn()`) to whichever column is selected and renders it through `PlotWidget`; axis-layout math (nice ticks, label formatting) lives in the Qt-free `plotaxismath` (`src/plotaxismath.{cpp,h}`). Both the old one-`ChartViewer`-per-column layout and the `ChartBackend`/QtCharts/QtGraphs abstraction were removed once the native single-view renderer reached parity.

**Threading model.** LAMMPS simulations run on a `LammpsRunner` (QThread). `StdCapture` intercepts the LAMMPS library's stdout by replacing the file descriptor before `LammpsRunner::run()` starts. A `QTimer` in `LammpsGui` polls `StdCapture::getChunk()` to feed `LogWindow` without blocking the UI thread.

**Auto-completion.** `CodeEditor` maintains a separate `QCompleter` instance for each LAMMPS command category (fix styles, compute styles, pair styles, etc.). Completions are populated from style lists queried from `LammpsWrapper` after LAMMPS is initialized, plus static tables embedded as Qt resources.

**Resources.** `resources/lammpsgui.qrc` embeds icons, `help_index.table` (maps LAMMPS commands to doc URLs), `image_style.table` (dump image options), and `lammps_internal_commands.txt`. The `.table` files are plain text and have companion shell scripts (`update-help-index.sh`, `update-image-styles.sh`) to regenerate them from a LAMMPS source tree.

**Constants and settings keys.** `src/constants.h` holds two intentionally short, internal namespaces: `Cfg` (application-wide magic numbers and repeated string literals -- UI dimensions, update intervals, resource paths, version constants) and `Keys` (every persisted QSettings key and group name). New hardcoded values and any new QSettings key go there. Reference them qualified -- `Cfg::PREFERENCES_WIDTH`, `Keys::ZOOM` -- never via `using namespace`/aliases: the namespaces are deliberately terse so the qualifier stays cheap, and the `Keys::` prefix keeps the generic key names (e.g. `NAME`, `TYPE`, `ID`) readable and collision-free. A mistyped settings key is then a compile error, not a silently lost setting.

**Minimum LAMMPS version.** `Cfg::MIN_LAMMPS_VERSION` (see `src/constants.h` for the current value) is enforced at startup; the GUI warns and may refuse to run with older LAMMPS builds.

**Dialog widget wiring.** `ImageViewer` and the `Preferences` tabs connect widgets to slots via `setObjectName("...")` + later `findChild<T>("...")` rather than stored member pointers. Preserve object names exactly when refactoring these dialogs (a wrong/renamed name fails the lookup silently, with no compile error).

**Shared helpers (prefer over re-rolling).** Use the `StdoutSilencer` RAII guard (`helpers.h`) instead of manual `silenceStdout()`/`restoreStdout()` pairs; the `QtMessageSilencer` RAII guard (`helpers.h`) around a call whose Qt-internal warnings are expected and handled (note it cannot catch messages a library prints straight to stderr, such as libpng's `libpng error:` lines); `LammpsWrapper::lastErrorMessage()` instead of a hand-managed `getLastErrorMessage()` buffer; `LammpsGui::addMenuAction()` to build menu actions; `monoFontFromSettings()` for the configured fixed-width font; `styleDialogButtons()` to apply the bundled SVG icons to a `QDialogButtonBox`; `toolButtonSize()`/`styleToolButtons()` for square toolbar buttons; `applyWindowFlags()` for the shared output-window WM hints; `retireViewMenuBar()` for a docked view's own menu bar (on macOS a `QMenuBar` is a handle on the system-wide bar, so a hidden one left native inside the main window blanks the real menu bar -- hiding it is not enough).

### String handling & modern C++ conventions

These are the settled conventions for new and refactored code; the staged
cleanup that brought the existing code into line is complete.

**QString is the canonical internal string type.** It already dominates
(~350 declarations vs. ~25 `std::string`). Keep `char *` and `std::string`
out of internal interfaces; pass and return `QString`.

**Confine all string conversions to `LammpsWrapper`** (the LAMMPS C API is
the only place `char *` is unavoidable). Do not sprinkle `toStdString()` /
`.c_str()` / `char buf[N]` at call sites. Two patterns already in the
wrapper are the templates to copy:
- *Input:* use either `const char *` or `const QString &`
  as `extractSetting()`, `extractGlobal()` or `command()`, `file()`.
  Do the former when only string constants are used as arguments.
- *Output:* return a `QString` and manage the buffer internally, as
  `lastErrorMessage()`, `idName()`, `styleName()`, and `variableInfo()` do
  (their `char *`-buffer variants are private implementation details behind
  the QString-returning public API).

Avoid `QString -> std::string -> QString` round-trips. `splitLine` now
parses the `QString` directly (via `utf16()`) and returns a `QStringList`;
the `toStdString()` calls that remain sit at genuine boundaries to
std::string-only subsystems (`LeptonMini`, `plotaxismath`, the LAMMPS
runner) rather than being gratuitous conversions.

**Match the existing modern-C++ baseline.** This code already uses
`nullptr`, `auto`, range-based `for`, `override`, `constexpr`, `= default`,
and an explicit Rule-of-5 (`= delete` / `= default` for all five special
members) on essentially every class; mirror that on new classes. Prefer
`std::make_unique` and smart pointers for owned non-QObject resources
(QObject parent/child ownership via `new` with a parent is still the Qt
idiom and is fine). Use `static_cast` rather than C-style casts, the
function-pointer `connect()` form (never `SIGNAL()`/`SLOT()` strings), and
`enum class` for new internal enumerations that do not need implicit `int`
interop with the LAMMPS API.

## AI-assistant feature (exploratory — temporary feature branch)

We are adding an AI assistant to the GUI frontend of this physics-simulation
software. Work is exploratory: build a **minimal** implementation first to probe
workflow options, then decide a fuller architecture and implement interactively.

**Before working on this feature, read `doc/ai-assistant-design.md`** — it is
the durable design memory (provider abstraction, RAG, reliability via
verification, tool-calling file generation, the wizard/expert-system model, the
probe verify-repair loop, and the case-based learning approach). Treat its
decisions and caveats as binding unless we explicitly revise them here.

### Non-negotiables for this feature

- The assistant produces a **starting point, not a validated solution.**
- Structural correctness comes from **vetted templates** and **executable
  verification (the simulator as oracle)** — never from the model's unaided
  judgment.
- **Treat all model-generated files as untrusted**; validate before loading.
- **Never hardcode or commit API keys.**
- Prefer **deterministic checks/lookup tables** for known cases; use the LLM for
  the fuzzy long tail and explanation.
