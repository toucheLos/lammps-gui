/**
 * @brief Presentation policy for the output views of the main window
 *
 * WindowLayout is the single place that decides *how* an output view is put
 * in front of the user.  LammpsGui creates and owns the view widgets and
 * keeps its typed pointers to them, but does not call show(), hide() or
 * isVisible() on them directly: it hands each widget to the layout with
 * place() and then addresses it by its ViewSlot.
 *
 * Two policies are available, chosen once at construction from the user
 * preference:
 *
 * - LayoutMode::Windows keeps every view an individual top-level window,
 *   freely placed and stacked, which is what the application has always done.
 * - LayoutMode::Docked puts the views into dock areas around the editor, which
 *   stays the central widget: the charts, image and slide show views share a
 *   tabbed group on the right, the log, the variables view and the command
 *   window share a group across the full width at the bottom.
 *
 * In docked mode the layout owns one QDockWidget per slot, created up front so
 * that a saved arrangement can be restored before the views themselves exist.
 * place() only swaps the content of the dock, so a view that is destroyed and
 * rebuilt (as the image viewer is on every render) keeps its position and its
 * place in the tab order.
 *
 * The layout never owns the view widgets themselves.  It watches them for
 * destruction, so a slot whose widget is deleted elsewhere empties itself and
 * never hands out a dangling pointer.
 *
 * @see LammpsGui for the owner of both the layout and the view widgets
